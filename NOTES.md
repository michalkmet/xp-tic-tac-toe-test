Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Code your TicTacToe game:

No user interaction is required.
The application should simulate bot vs. bot games.
You can choose any programming language.
Follow state-of-the-art methodologies and practices.
Use Git as version control and public or IBM GitHub as a host.
Maintain a notes file in the repo and commit everything after each step you make, so the trainers can follow your thinking and practices.
Optional, but recommended: host the result in a cloud environment.

Rules for Tic-Tac-Toe
Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
